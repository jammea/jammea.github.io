    <h2>Songs</h2>
    
    <p>A wagging tail, a joyful bark,<br>
Bright eyes that twinkle in the dark.<br>
Through every storm, through thick and thin,<br> A dogâ€™s true love will pull you in.</p> 

<p>They race through fields, so wild, so free,<br>
Their paws in sync with wind and sea.<br>
No judgment comes, no spite nor guile,<br>
Just endless trust and boundless smile.</p>

<p>A gentle nudge, a loyal gaze,<br>
A comfort found in rainy days.<br>
A quiet friend, a steadfast guide,<br>
A heart that beats right by your side.</p>
